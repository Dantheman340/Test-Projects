There were many interesting topics covered in our last class, many of which helped to shed light on my personal experience in the workplace.  For example, the three-schema architecture is something that I did not even realize I was working within while writing/running queries at work.  Often times I would construct a value in the SELECT statement of a SQL query, for example “concat(firstname, “ “,lastname), and rename it to “full name”.  This was translating the Internal schema of the database tables into Conceptual schema, something which is easier to understand. Additionally, learning that the database has two different types of languages, DML and DDL was very insightful.  In my day to day work at the office, I interact with the database using DML (SQL to be specific).  It makes sense now, thinking about DB access/modification control, that I was not able to interact with the database using a DDL.
